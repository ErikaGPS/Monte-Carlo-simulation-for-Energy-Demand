Monte Carlo simulations incorporate parameter ranges for ammonia production pathway and capacity factors for renewable energy.
Can change technology by changing range. For example, if you want to see the effect of switching ammonia engine technology (e.g., simulate with SOFC instead of ICE) 
, change efficiency range.
